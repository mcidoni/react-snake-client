## Snake.js

Welcome to Snek.js! This is my take on the classic snake game that was popularized on Nokia's older phones. I designed this to have a whimiscal look, and to be easy to use for all users!

## How To Play

V1 (MVP): 
- Sign up and/or sign in
- Type a number into the score field and hit submit
- To update/delete score, simply click on the score field and updated it, or click the "x" to delete it

## Technologies Used

#### Front-End

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS/CSS Grid
- Bootstrap

#### Back-End

- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js
- Mongoose

## Future Development

V2: 
- Snake will be able to move (as it does in the traditional snake game)
- Score will be able to go as high as the user can get it!

## User Stories

- As a user, I would like to create an account
- As a user, I would like to sign in
- As a user, I would like to play the shown game
- As a user, I would like to view my high score
- As a user, I would like to delete past high scores
